# GlugNetOctoCat
Source control DEMO 1

This is a very small console application that allows a user to name an octocat and then attempts to get more information about the cat.  

Code focuses on:
1)  Text editing and concatenation
2)  Getting user input within a console application
3)  Having your app attempt to carry on a normal sounding conversation as it captures information from the user.  

Enjoy!
